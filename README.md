## Problem ##
Current financial options formulas are not designed for extreme movements in stock prices, which occur more frequently than current models believe. Because of this, there is a lot of opportunity for option buyers to make large profits when stocks make an extreme upward movement, but there are no useful tools in the marketplace to spot these opportunites.

## Solution ##
Fractal Options is a data product for options traders to identify the best options available to buy for a stock in case its stock price makes an extreme upward movement. ~98% of the stocks in the U.S. stock market are avaialbe in this product.

## Future Work ##
The best options to buy for upside movement are available, but the best available options for extreme downward movement in the stock price are not available. Given more time, I would implement these choices using an alternative formula for the Implied Alpha metric.
